# lang


Screwing around with ideas for making a language. More just an exercise than anything serious, but if I get it working i might end up actually using it in my own projects


lex.hpp/lex.cpp: very early test of a lexer, doesn't even come close to implementing a full language lexer, that requires a specification first : ^ )


description.txt: a bunch of thoughts about how the syntax will end up working, feedback appreciated!


example.lang/MyModule.lang: a very simple example to show how some of the features would work in practice, very early
